By restricting access to these services, you reduce your exposure to attacks. You can do this using firewalls or network devices with firewall functionality. For cloud services, you can achieve this using data flow policies.</p><p>A boundary firewall is a network device which can restrict the inbound and outbound network traffic to services on its network of computers and mobile devices. It can help protect against cyber attacks by implementing restrictions, known as ‘firewall rules,’ which can allow or block traffic depending on its source, destination and type of communication protocol.</p><p>Alternatively, if your organisation doesn't control the network to which a device connects, you must configure a software firewall on the device. This works in the same way as a boundary firewall but only protects the single device on which it’s configured. This approach allows for more tailored rules and means that the rules apply to the device wherever it's used. But you should note that this creates a greater administrative overhead when managing firewall rules.</p>",
