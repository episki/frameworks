      "description": "<p>Network security controls (NSCs), such as firewalls and other network security technologies, are network policy enforcement points that typically control network traffic between two or more logical or physical network segments (or subnets) based on pre-defined <em>policies</em> or <em>rules</em>.</p><p>NSCs examine all network traffic entering (ingress) and leaving (egress) a segment and decide, based on the policies defined, whether the network traffic is allowed to pass or whether it should be rejected. Typically, NSCs are placed between environments with different security needs or levels of trust, however in some environments NSCs control the traffic to individual devices irrespective of trust boundaries. Policy enforcement generally occurs at layer 3 of the OSI model, but data present in higher layers is also frequently used to determine policy decisions.</p><p>Traditionally this function has been provided by physical firewalls; however, now this functionality may be provided by virtual devices, cloud access controls, virtualization/container systems, and other software-defined networking technology.</p><p>NSCs are used to control traffic within an entity’s own networks—for example, between highly sensitive and less sensitive areas—and also to protect the entity’s resources from exposure to untrusted networks. The cardholder data environment (CDE) is an example of a more sensitive area within an entity’s network. Often, seemingly insignificant paths to and from untrusted networks can provide unprotected pathways into sensitive systems. NSCs provide a key protection mechanism for any computer network.</p><p>Common examples of untrusted networks include the Internet, dedicated connections such as business-to-business communication channels, wireless networks, carrier networks (such as cellular), third-party networks, and other sources outside the entity’s ability to control. Furthermore, untrusted networks also include corporate networks that are considered out-of-scope for PCI DSS, because they are not assessed, and therefore must be treated as untrusted because the existence of security controls has not been verified. While an entity may consider an internal network to be trusted from an infrastructure perspective, if a network is out of scope for PCI DSS, that network must be considered untrusted for PCI DSS.</p><p>Refer to <em>Appendix G </em>for definitions of PCI DSS terms.</p>",

              "description": "<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p><p>Systems containing a combination of services, protocols, and daemons for their primary function will have a security profile appropriate to allow that function to operate effectively. For example, systems that need to be directly connected to the Internet would have a particular profile, like a DNS server, web server, or an e-commerce server. Conversely, other system components may operate a primary function comprising a different set of services, protocols, and daemons that perform functions that an entity does not want exposed to the Internet. This requirement aims to ensure that different functions do not impact the security profiles of other services in a way which may cause them to operate at a higher or lower security level.</p><p><strong>Good Practice</strong></p><p>Ideally, each function should be placed on different system components. This can be achieved by implementing only one primary function on each system component. Another option is to isolate primary functions on the same system component that have different security levels, for example, isolating web servers (which need to be directly connected to the Internet) from application and database servers.</p><p>If a system component contains primary functions that need different security levels, a third option is to implement additional controls to ensure that the resultant security level of the primary function(s) with higher security needs is not reduced by the presence of the lower security primary functions. Additionally, the functions with a lower security level should be isolated and/or secured to ensure they cannot access or affect the resources of another system function, and do not introduce security weaknesses to other functions on the same server.</p><p>Functions of differing security levels may be isolated by either physical or logical controls. For example, a database system should not also be hosting web services unless using controls like virtualization technologies to isolate and contain the functions into separate sub-systems. Another example is using virtual instances or providing dedicated memory access by system function.</p><p>Where virtualization technologies are used, the security levels should be identified and managed for each virtual component. Examples of considerations for virtualized environments include:</p><ul class=\"list-disc\"><li><p>The function of each application, container, or virtual server instance.</p></li><li><p>How virtual machines (VMs) or containers are stored and secured.</p></li></ul>",

However, proper controls must be in place to ensure that memory maintains a non-persistent state.

The only account data that may be stored after authorization is the primary account number or PAN (rendered unreadable), expiration date, cardholder name, and service code.</p><p>The storage of SAD data prior to the completion of the authorization process is also included in the data retention and disposal policy so that storage of this sensitive data is kept to minimum, and only retained for the defined amount of time.</p><p><strong>Good Practice</strong></p><p>When identifying locations of stored account data, consider all processes and personnel with access to the data, as data could have been moved and stored in different locations than originally defined. Storage locations that are often overlooked include backup and archive systems, removable data storage devices, paper-based media, and audio recordings.</p><p>To define appropriate retention requirements, an entity first needs to understand its own business needs as well as any legal or regulatory obligations that apply to its industry or to the type of data being retained. Implementing an automated process to ensure data is automatically and securely deleted upon its defined retention limit can help ensure that account data is not retained beyond what is necessary for business, legal, or regulatory purposes.</p><p>Methods of eliminating data when it exceeds the retention period include secure deletion to complete removal of the data or rendering it unrecoverable and unable to be reconstructed. Identifying and securely eliminating stored data that has exceeded its specified retention period prevents unnecessary retention of data that is no longer needed. This process may be automated, manual, or a combination of both.</p><p>The deletion function in most operating systems is not “secure deletion” as it allows deleted data to be recovered, so instead, a dedicated secure deletion function or application must be used to make data unrecoverable.</p><p><em>Remember, if you don't need it, don't store it!</em></p><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><p>An automated, programmatic procedure could be run to locate and remove data, or a manual review of data storage areas could be performed. Whichever method is used, it is a good idea to monitor the process to ensure it is completed successfully, and that the results are recorded and validated as being complete. Implementing secure deletion methods ensures that the data cannot be retrieved when it is no longer needed.</p><p><strong>Further Information</strong></p><p>See <em>NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1, Guidelines for Media Sanitization.</em></p>",

While it is not required that strong cryptography be applied at both the data level and the session level, it is strongly recommended. If encrypted at the data level, the cryptographic keys used for protecting the data can be managed in accordance with Requirements 3.6 and 3.7. If the data is encrypted at the session level, designated key custodians should be assigned responsibility for managing transmission keys and certificates.</p><p>Some protocol implementations (such as SSL, SSH v1.0, and early TLS) have known vulnerabilities that an attacker can use to gain access to the cleartext data. It is critical that entities maintain awareness of industry-defined deprecation dates for the cipher suites they are using and are prepared to migrate to newer versions or protocols when older ones are no longer deemed secure.</p><p>Verifying that certificates are trusted helps ensure the integrity of the secure connection. To be considered trusted, a certificate should be issued from a trusted source, such as a trusted certificate authority (CA), and not be expired. Up-to-date Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) can be used to validate certificates.</p><p>Techniques to validate certificates may include certificate and public key pinning, where the trusted certificate or a public key is pinned either during development or upon its first use. Entities can also confirm with developers or review source code to ensure that clients and servers reject connections if the certificate is bad.</p><p>For browser-based TLS certificates, certificate trust can often be verified by clicking on the lock icon that appears next to the address bar.</p><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><p>Open, public networks include, but are not limited to:</p><ul class=\"list-disc\"><li><p>The Internet and</p></li><li><p>Wireless technologies, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular technologies, and satellite communications.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Further Information</strong></p><p>Vendor recommendations and industry best practices can be consulted for information about the proper encryption strength specific to the encryption methodology in use.</p><p>For more information about strong cryptography and secure protocols, see industry standards and best practices such as NIST SP 800-52 and SP 800-57.</p><p>For more information about trusted keys and certificates, see NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide Special Publication 1800-16, Securing Web Transactions: Transport Layer Security (TLS) Server Certificate Management.</p>",

This process should include multiple sources of vulnerability information, including industry-recognized vulnerability databases (for example, the US National Vulnerability Database), CERTs, RSS feeds, information received from vendors and third parties, and vulnerabilities identified via internal and external vulnerability scans (Requirements 11.3.1 and 11.3.2). This will help to ensure all vulnerabilities are properly identified and addressed. Processes should support ongoing evaluation of vulnerabilities. For example, a vulnerability initially identified as low risk could become a higher risk later.

These IDs (also referred to as “accounts”) fundamentally establish the identity of an individual or process by assigning unique identification to each person or process to distinguish one user or process from another. When each user or process can be uniquely identified, it ensures there is accountability for actions performed by that identity. When such accountability is in place, actions taken can be traced to known and authorized users and processes.</p><p>The element used to prove or verify the identity is known as the authentication factor. Authentication factors are 1) something you know, such as a password or passphrase, 2) something you have, such as a token device or smart card, or 3) something you are, such as a biometric element.</p><p>The ID and the authentication factor together are considered authentication credentials and are used to gain access to the rights and privileges associated with a user, application, system, or service accounts.</p><p>These requirements for identity and authentication are based on industry-accepted security principles and best practices to support the payment ecosystem. NIST Special Publication 800-63, Digital Identity Guidelines provides additional information on acceptable frameworks for digital identity and authentication factors. It is important to note that the NIST Digital Identity Guidelines is intended for US Federal Agencies and should be viewed in its entirety. Many of the concepts and approaches defined in these guidelines are expected to work with each other and not as standalone parameters.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Unless otherwise stated in the requirement, these requirements apply to all accounts on all system components, unless specifically called out in an individual requirement, including but not limited to:</p><ul class=\"list-disc\"><li><p>Point-of-sale accounts</p></li><li><p>Accounts with administrative capabilities</p></li><li><p>System and application accounts</p></li><li><p>All accounts used to view or access cardholder data or to access systems with cardholder data.</p></li></ul><p>This includes accounts used by employees, contractors, consultants, internal and external vendors, and other third parties (for example, for providing support or maintenance services).</p><p>Certain requirements are not intended to apply to user accounts on point-of-sale terminals that have access to only one card number at a time to facilitate a single transaction.

              "description": "<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p><p>Attackers spend a lot of time finding external and internal vulnerabilities to leverage to obtain access to cardholder data and then to exfiltrate that data. As such, entities need to test their networks thoroughly, just as an attacker would do. This testing allows the entity to identify and remediate weakness that might be leveraged to compromise the entity’s network and data, and then to take appropriate actions to protect the network and system components from such attacks.</p><p><strong>Good Practice</strong></p><p>Penetration testing techniques will differ based on an organization’s needs and structure and should be suitable for the tested environment—for example, fuzzing, injection, and forgery tests might be appropriate. The type, depth, and complexity of the testing will depend on the specific environment and the needs of the organization.</p><p><strong>Definitions</strong></p><p>Penetration tests simulate a real-world attack situation intending to identify how far an attacker could penetrate an environment, given differing amounts of information provided to the tester. This allows an entity to better understand its potential exposure and develop a strategy to defend against attacks. A penetration test differs from a vulnerability scan, as a penetration test is an active process that usually includes exploiting identified vulnerabilities.</p><p>Scanning for vulnerabilities alone is not a penetration test, nor is a penetration test adequate if the focus is solely on trying to exploit vulnerabilities found in a vulnerability scan. Conducting a vulnerability scan may be one of the first steps, but it is not the only step a penetration tester will perform to plan the testing strategy. Even if a vulnerability scan does not detect known vulnerabilities, the penetration tester will often gain enough knowledge about the system to identify possible security gaps.</p><p>Penetration testing is a highly manual process. While some automated tools may be used, the tester uses their knowledge of systems to gain access into an environment. Often the tester will chain several types of exploits together with the goal of breaking through layers of defenses. For example, if the tester finds a way to gain access to an application server, the tester will then use the compromised server as a point to stage a new attack based on the resources to which the server has access. In this way, a tester can simulate the techniques used by an attacker to identify areas of potential weakness in the environment. The testing of security monitoring and detection methods—for example, to confirm the effectiveness of logging and file integrity monitoring mechanisms, should also be considered.</p><p><strong>Further Information</strong></p><p>Refer to the <em>Information Supplement: Penetration Testing Guidance </em>for additional guidance.</p><p>Industry-accepted penetration testing approaches include: </p><p><em>The Open Source Security Testing Methodology and Manual (OSSTMM)</em></p><p><em>Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) penetration testing programs.</em></p>",

              "description": "<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p><p>Internal penetration testing serves two purposes. Firstly, just like an external penetration test, it discovers vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that could be used by an attacker that had managed to get some degree of access to the internal network, whether that is because the attacker is an authorized user conducting unauthorized activities, or an external attacker that had managed to penetrate the entity’s perimeter.</p><p>Secondly, internal penetration testing also helps entities to discover where their change control process failed by detecting previously unknown systems. Additionally, it verifies the status of many of the controls operating within the CDE.</p><p>A penetration test is not truly a “test” because the outcome of a penetration test is not something that can be classified as a “pass” or a “fail.” The best outcome of a test is a catalog of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that an entity did not know about, and the penetration tester found them before an attacker could. A penetration test that found nothing is typically indicative of shortcomings of the penetration tester, rather than being a positive reflection of the security posture of the entity.</p><p><strong>Good Practice</strong></p><p>Some considerations when choosing a qualified resource to perform penetration testing include:</p><ul class=\"list-disc\"><li><p>Specific penetration testing certifications, which may be an indication of the tester’s skill level and competence.</p></li><li><p>Prior experience conducting penetration testing—for example, the number of years of experience, and the type and scope of prior engagements can help confirm whether the tester’s experience is appropriate for the needs of the engagement.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Further Information</strong></p><p>Refer to the<em> Information Supplement: Penetration Testing Guidance</em> on the PCI SSC website for additional guidance.</p>",

When deciding where to place this control, entities should consider critical locations in the network, and likely routes for covert channels.</p><p>When malware establishes a foothold in an infected environment, it often tries to establish a communication channel to a command-and-control (C&amp;C) server. Through the C&amp;C server, the attacker communicates with and controls malware on compromised systems to deliver malicious payloads or instructions, or to initiate data exfiltration. In many cases, the malware will communicate with the C&amp;C server indirectly via botnets, bypassing monitoring, blocking controls, and rendering these methods ineffective to detect the covert channels.</p><p><strong>Good Practice</strong></p><p>Methods that can help detect and address malware communications channels include real-time endpoint scanning, egress traffic filtering, an ”allow” listing, data loss prevention tools, and network security monitoring tools such as IDS/IPS. Additionally, DNS queries and responses are a key data source used by network defenders in support of incident response as well as intrusion discovery.

                  "description": "<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p><p>The ability to identify attack patterns and undesirable behavior across systems—for example, using centrally managed or automated log-correlation tools— is critical in preventing, detecting, or minimizing the impact of a data compromise. The presence of logs in all environments allows thorough tracking, alerting, and analysis when something goes wrong. Determining the cause of a compromise is very difficult, if not impossible, without a process to corroborate information from critical system components and systems that perform security functions, such as network security controls, IDS/IPS, and file integrity monitoring (FIM) systems. Thus, logs for all critical system components and systems that perform security functions need to be collected, correlated, and maintained. This could include using software products and service methodologies to provide real-time analysis, alerting, and reporting, such as security information and event management (SIEM), FIM, or change detection.</p>",
