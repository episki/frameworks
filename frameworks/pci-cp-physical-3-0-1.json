      "description": "<p>A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a permanent security configuration that controls Security Management Systems and maintains a high level of protection for buildings, assets, access, and staff. The SOC is optional and when implemented provides a centralized location to monitor, manage, and administer the CCTV, Access Control, and Alarm Systems for multiple facilities. A vendor may implement one or more SOCs such that each SOC provides security services for multiple (2 or more) facilities. When a SOC is present, it is located at a card production facility that is approved by the Vendor Program Administrator (VPA) for card production activities, and the SOC is expected to only monitor card production facilities that are either VPA-approved or are seeking VPA approval. These facilities are owned and operated by the card vendor who operates the SOC.</p><p>When a SOC controls the security activities of multiple facilities, a local Security Control Room (SCR) is maintained at each facility for backup purposes in the event the SOC loses connectivity or otherwise becomes non-operational. Therefore, a local SCR is present at each facility managed by a SOC except for the facility at which the SOC is located where it is optional. The local SCR contains fully functional security control systems, but the day-to-day operations are performed by the SOC. Security guards that would normally perform SCR activities and other security functions that do not require a physical presence at the local facility may perform these activities from the SOC. When a SOC is temporarily not operational, local guards and predefined staff members at the affected facilities are expected to perform all tasks necessary to ensure continuous compliance with the security standard.</p><p>The SOC security requirements in this section duplicate many of the requirements already contained in other sections of PCI Card Production and Provisioning Security Requirements. This is intentional as a SOC is only evaluated against the security requirements in Appendix C and the rest of the card production facility is assessed against the balance of the requirements. A card production facility that uses a SOC for security services is assessed for compliance with all physical and logical security requirements except where an exception is explicitly permitted for when a SOC is implemented. The SOC must be VPA-approved before becoming operational and is included in the scope of the annual assessment performed by a qualified CPSA.</p>",

A graphical map will then display the location of the alarm, and the most relevant camera images will appear on the workstation monitors. This will quickly provide the SOC operator with all the information required to investigate potential incidents and initiate appropriate responses.</p>",
