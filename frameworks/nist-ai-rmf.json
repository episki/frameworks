Disparate impact is broadly defined as a facially neutral policy or practice that disproportionately harms a group based on a protected trait. Notably, some modeling algorithms or debiasing techniques that rely on demographic information, could also come into tension with legal prohibitions on disparate treatment (i.e., intentional discrimination).</p><p>Additionally, some intended users of AI systems may not have consistent or reliable access to fundamental internet technologies (a phenomenon widely described as the “digital divide”) or may experience difficulties interacting with AI systems due to disabilities or impairments.

Risk tolerance rating policies consider different sources of risk, (e.g., financial, operational, safety and wellbeing, business, reputational, or model risks). A typical risk measurement approach entails the multiplication, or qualitative combination, of measured or estimated impact and likelihood of impacts into a risk score (risk ≈ impact x likelihood). This score is then placed on a risk scale. Scales for risk may be qualitative, such as red-amber-green (RAG), or may entail simulations or econometric approaches.

The interdependencies between these activities, and among the relevant AI actors and organizations, can make it difficult to reliably anticipate potential impacts of AI systems. For example, early decisions in identifying the purpose and objective of an AI system can alter its behavior and capabilities, and the dynamics of deployment setting (such as end users or impacted individuals) can shape the positive or negative impacts of AI system decisions. As a result, the best intentions within one dimension of the AI lifecycle can be undermined via interactions with decisions and conditions in other, later activities. This complexity and varying levels of visibility can introduce uncertainty. And, once deployed and in use, AI systems may sometimes perform poorly, manifest unanticipated negative impacts, or violate legal or ethical norms.
